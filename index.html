<h1>mope.io Animals Test</h1>
<br>
<button class="button" onclick="location.href='quiz.html';" style="font-size:36pt;">Click here to start!</button>


<h2>What animal would you be if you were in the Mope World?</h2>
    <p>If you were confused at first or you were curious about it, this test will help you for that. It even works for self-development because with self-development, you can get higher tier animals! You will be presented by a statement, and then you will answer with your opinion on the statement, from <b>Strongly Agree</b> to <b>Strongly Disagree</b>, with each answer slightly affecting your scores. At the end of the quiz, your answers will be compared to the maximum possible for each value, thus giving you a percentage. Answer honestly!<br /><br />
    There are <b><u><span id="numOfQuestions"></span></u></b> questions in the test.</p>

<h2>What determines my animal?</h2>
    <p><b>There are four animal axes - Versatility, Diet, Sociality, and Trophic - and each has two opposing values assigned to them. They are:</b></p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#6aff00;">Versatile</b> (Versatility)<br/>
        Versatile animals have a wide niche and they tend to be adaptable. They can live in varied conditions. Note that this is the versatility in game.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#1100ff;">Specialized</b> (Versatility)<br/>
        Specialized animals have a narrowe niche and they are better in consistent environments. They need to have specific conditions to live. Note that this is the versatility in game.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#009e03;">Herbivore</b> (Diet)<br/>
        Herbivores prefer a plant-based diet and/or thinks that eating plants is superior to eating meat. They are less likely to kill animals. This is based on real life.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#9e0000;">Carnivore</b> (Diet)<br/>
        Carnivores prefer a meat-based diet and/or thinks that eating meat is superior to eating plants. They don't mind about killing animals. This is based on real life.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#ff0095;">Social</b> (Sociality)<br/>
        Social animals like having social groups to hunt/live more effectively. They have a more positive view about teamwork. This doesn't necessarily mean they are dependent on others. This is based on real life.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#00fff2;">Solitary</b> (Sociality)<br/>
        Solitary animals like hunting and/or living independently. They have a more positive view about solitude. They are more likely to think that groups are a waste of time. This is based on real life.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#bf9d73;">Prey</b> (Trophic)<br/>
        Prey animals tend to think that they are victims. They are more likely to be dependent on others for their lives and they are more afraid of failing. Note that this is based on the food chain in the game.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#ff8c00;">Predator</b> (Trophic)<br/>
        Predator animals live for accomplishments and they prefer the hard mode over the easy mode. They are self-reliant and strong. Note that this is based on the food chain in the game.</p>
	<p><b>There are also two biome axes - Temperature and Humidity - and they also have two opposing values assigned to them. They are:</b></p>
	<p class="value-description"><b style="color:#ff3700;">Hot</b> (Temperature)<br/>
        </p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#95f0ee;">Cold</b> (Temperature)<br/>
        </p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#3aab8f;">Moist</b> (Humidity)<br/>
        </p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#c9c940;">Dry</b> (Humidity)<br/>
        </p>
<h2>I don't like my scores or my animal!</h2>
    <p><b>If you have gotten a prey animal on that test, then it's time for some self-development! Stop playing mope.io and grow out of your comfort zone!</b></p>
	<p>If you have gotten a predator animal and you still don't like it, then there's no reason to not like it. Embrace your animal!</p>
